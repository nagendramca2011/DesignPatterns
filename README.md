Design Pattern
===============
### Creational Pattern

Creational design patterns are concerned with `the way of creating objects`. These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class).

* [Factory Method Pattern][]
* [Abstract Factory Pattern][]
* [Singleton Pattern][]
* [Prototype Pattern][]
* [Builder Pattern][]
* [Object Pool Pattern][]

### Structural Pattern

`Structural design patterns` are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.

The structural design patterns `simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships`.

These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.

* [Adapter Pattern][]
* [Bridge Pattern][]
* [Composite Pattern][]
* [Decorator Pattern][]
* [Facade Pattern][]
* [Flyweight Pattern][]
* [Proxy Pattern][]

### Behavioral Pattern

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with `the interaction and responsibility of objects`.

In these design patterns,`the interaction between the objects should be in such a way that they can easily talk to each other and still should be loosely coupled`
.

That means the implementation and the client should be loosely coupled in order to avoid hard coding and dependencies.

* [Chain of Responsibility][]
* [Command Pattern][]
* [Interpreter Pattern][]
* [Iterator Pattern][]
